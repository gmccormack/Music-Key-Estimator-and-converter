# Music-Key-Estimator-and-converter

This project is a desktop application that records a tune,saves it as a .wav file and implements the krumhansl schmuckler key finding algorithm to display an estimated musical key signature. 
It then gives the user the option to change the musical key up or down without effecting the speed of the play back. This was implemented using the tarsos dsp api. 

Currently only working with .wav files.
